##  Producer-Consumer Problem

####  Producer-Consumer Problem with Shared Memory and Semaphores:

 1. Simulate a producer-consumer problem using shared memory for data exchange.
 2. Use semaphores to manage access to the shared memory and ensure synchronization.
 {3. Extend the project by adding multithreading on both the producer and consumer sides.}

## Priority-Based Task Scheduler:

   Implement a task scheduler that assigns priorities to tasks (threads) and uses data structures like heaps or priority queues to manage task execution.
   Threads representing tasks will be scheduled based on their priorities, ensuring proper synchronization between threads.
